# Customer Churning model

## Project Objective
Develop a machine learning model to accurately predict customer churn in a telecommunications company. By analyzing customer demographic information, service usage patterns, and historical churn data, the goal is to identify factors contributing to churn and build a predictive model that can proactively identify at-risk customers. The ultimate objective is to help the company reduce churn rates, improve customer retention, and enhance overall business profitability.

## About Data
The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn). The dataset contains details on customers who have recently stopped using the service (churned) along with the services they subscribed to, such as phone, internet, online security, etc. It also includes account information like customer tenure, contract type, payment method, billing preferences, and financial details such as monthly and total charges. Additionally, demographic information such as gender, age group, and whether they have partners or dependents is provided.
